# Multi-Repo

Manage multiple repositories within a single NERV project. Connected repos, CLAUDE.md knowledge bases, and git worktrees are all accessible from the dashboard.

## 1. Kanban Board

Tasks span across both repos — you can see completed, in-progress, and queued work at a glance.

## 3. Knowledge Base

The **Knowledge Base** panel shows CLAUDE.md files from each repo. Claude reads these to understand every codebase's conventions and architecture.

## 4. Git Worktrees

The **Worktrees** panel shows isolated git worktrees per task. Each agent works in its own worktree to avoid conflicts.
